# ml (machine learning)

This repository presents different applications of supervisory learning. It is based on Python 3, sklearn and jupyter notebook. 

The purpose is to help users to understand the different tools applied in machine learning. 

Introductory files (/learning_material):
* __loading_data.ipynb__ - Introduces how to use numpy and pandas to create a dataframe
* __dataframe_practices.ipynb__ - Presents examples on how to organize a dataframe
* __classification_algs.ipynb__ - This shows how to use different types of classifiers.
* __metrics.ipynb__ - Presents different types of metrics and how to use them.
* __2_class_data.csv__ - A data to use in the examples
* __learning_curves.ipynb__ - A method to evaluate the model performance between underfit, just right and overfit.
* __grid_score__ - A method to select multiple parameters in the model

Applications (/Projects):
* __boston_housing.ipynb__ - A linear regression model to predict housing prices
* __sms_spam_det.ipynb__ - A classifier based on Naive Bayes to detect SPAM - SMS messages
* __titanic.ipynb__ - A classifier to detect if a passanger survived or died during the Titanic disaster. There are two implementations, one using SVM and another using Decision Trees.
