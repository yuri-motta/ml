    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "To find a donor for CharityML, I will choose the following models: Decision Trees, SVM, and AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the __Decision Trees__ application, the main __strenghts__ are:\n",
    "* First it is flexible because it can be applied for both regression and classification problems. For instance, it could be used to determine the price of a house, or even for if a student would pass for fail in a course. \n",
    "* Second, this model requires little preparation of data and it is possible to visualize the trees and it is simple to understand and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __weak points__ are:\n",
    "* It can over-complex trees that do not generalize data well, which overfits.\n",
    "* This model can be unstable because small variations in data might result in a completely different tree being generated [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, I believe this model is an appropriate candidate because it will allow to visualize the trees generated as well as it will be able to understand a possible problem in the construction of the trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In relation to the __SVM__ model, the __strenghts__ are:\n",
    "* It is effective in high dimensional spaces. For example, this model performs efficiently when dealing with complex problems, in a case when it is necessary to deal with numerous features [2].\n",
    "* It is versatil since it allows to use different kernel functions as well as to customize a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an application in the industry, this model can be used to deal with medical image, such as detecting a cancer tumor in a mammography [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "The __weak points__ are:\n",
    "* Lack of transparency in the results [4]. Differently of the decision trees, in this model it is not easy to visualize and interpret the results.\n",
    "* Difficultty in choosing the adequate kernel [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, this model is a strong candidate because it will perform effectively in case our data requires a complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, concerning the __Ada Boost__ model the __strenghts__ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different from other classifiers such as SVM, the Ada Boost can reach effective results requiring less tweaking in the parameters or configuration. Of course, unless it is used with an SVM kernel function [6].\n",
    "* AdaBoost is not prone to overfitting [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "The __weak points__ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* AdaBoost can be sensitive to noise data and outliers [6,7]. This model is affected by outliers because it tries to fit the points perfectly.\n",
    "* It must be adjusted for cost-sensitive or imbalanced class problems [8]. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of application, there is a work that detected fatique driving using Ada Boost [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "From my perspective, this model is a strong candidate for this project because it might be easier to select the right parameters for the fitting process.\n",

    "It was developed a machine learning model that will help CharityML to find donors. Indeed, the algorithm is called Ada Boost, which means Adaptative Boosting and it is based on another algorithm called Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, Ada Boost is an ensemble method, which means that it has multiple weak learners, and they combine themselves at the end into one strong learner. This process is based on adaptation, which works in the following way. At the beggining of the training, each weak learner has equal weight. Then, on each round, the weights of the misclassified examples are increased. In fact, the weak learners are forced to focus on the tough examples to classify. As a consequence, the overall accuracy will increase during this process. By the end, there will be many weak learners trained and they will be combined as a cascade, this will form a strong learner, which is able to perform the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the base estimator of the Ada Boost is a Decision Tree. What means that? Ok... it is simply a conditional instance that returns a \"yes\" or a \"no\" given a specific question. For example, when it is asked, \"is this person is a woman?\" Then the tree says \"yes\", if that is true. So, that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, each weak learner is a Decision Tree that answer questions throughout the process, when those weak learners are put together they form the Ada Boost model. Indeed, the answers of each tree are put together and they form a very good guess to classify our problem. In the case of CharityML, our model will say if a person receives more than $50k or not."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
