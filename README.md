# ml (machine learning)

This repository presents different applications of surpervised and unsupervised learning. It is based on Python 3, Sklearn and Jupyter Notebook. 

_Applications (/projects):_
* __/boston_housing__ - A linear regression model to predict housing prices.
* __/sms_spam_det__ - A classifier based on Naive Bayes to detect SPAM - SMS messages.
* __/titanic__ - A classifier to detect if a passanger survived or died during the Titanic disaster.

_Studying material (/learning_material):_
* __loading_data.ipynb__ - Introduces how to use numpy and pandas to create a dataframe
* __dataframe_practices.ipynb__ - Presents examples on how to organize a dataframe
* __classification_algs.ipynb__ - This shows how to use different types of classifiers.
* __metrics.ipynb__ - Presents different types of metrics and how to use them.
* __2_class_data.csv__ - A data to use in the examples
* __learning_curves.ipynb__ - A method to evaluate the model performance between underfit, just right and overfit.
* __grid_score__ - A method to select multiple parameters in the model
